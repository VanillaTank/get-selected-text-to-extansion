This project is about getting selected text into chrome extansion and displaying it to ext. popup window.
The project is written on manifest v. 3 and I did a lot of work to port it from Mv2 like it was in the video.

This app takes numbers (assumed to be in ounce), converts them to grams and shows in popup window.

Why is the leaf icon and not a ruler or something like that? Because I like leaves )
